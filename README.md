# BLT - for 1.12 Vanilla WoW

Bloodlust timer. Will create a frame letting you know how much time is left until your shamans bloodlust is back up. 

Frame is not movable and hardcoded to the exact size and location on my UI I wanted it, sorry.

November 1, 2024 update: Turtle has removed casting bloodlust on others and this wasn't an orginal Vanilla ability so this addon likely has no use anywhere anymore
